# SCU - Applications in 'Emergent' Technology

### Week 0

Hello all, and welcome to the course. Before we begin exploring nascent and emerging technologies, let's aquaint ourselves with some knowledge resources for more 'traditional' and entrenched information technology. These resources will be essential for us to understand how emerging technologies might interface or outdate current systems.

#### Online Community and Database Resources
1. Wikipedia (of course)
2. [Webopedia, online IT terminology database](https://www.webopedia.com/)

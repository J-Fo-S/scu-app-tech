# SCU - Applications in 'Emergent' Technology

### Week 0

Hello all, and welcome to the course. Before we begin exploring nascent and emerging technologies, let's aquaint ourselves with some knowledge resources for fundamental information technology. These resources will be essential for us to understand how emerging technologies will relate to information technology, information systems and business.

#### Online Community and Database Resources
1. Wikipedia (of course)
2. [Webopedia, online IT terminology database](https://www.webopedia.com/)
3. [StackExchange, probably the best community knowledge source for all things tech](https://stackexchange.com/sites#technology)
4. [Quora, less technical than StackExchange but often useful](https://www.quora.com/sitemap)

#### Free Courses for Reference and Self-Directed Learning
1. [Marketing in a Digital World], University of Illinois](https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-marketing-in-a-digital-world-2750)
2. [IT Fundamentalsfor Business Professionals, UPValencia](https://www.edx.org/course/it-fundamentals-business-professionals-upvalenciax-isc101-3x)
3. [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming, MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/unit-1/)
4. [Build a Modern Computer from First Principles, Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-build-a-modern-computer-from-first-principles-from-nand-to-tetris-project-centered-course-3234)

### Week 1

To begin, let's define two different concepts: <b>information systems</b> and <b>information technology</b>. Let's think information systems as performing processes for businesses and people, and information technology as the hardware and software required for these processes. These are very broad ideas, but the distinction will be helpful for us to analyze the many different roles and relationships technology and business. 

For this weeks task, you are going to work in teams to practice quickly disseminating information. As you will see, there is quite a lot of information on information systems and information technology, and even reading through basic introductions to the field could take weeks (months? years?). We could do it this way, but we also want to explore beyond just the basics.

Also, in real life, business leaders and managers often have to make decisions about complex topics for which they possess little information about at the outset. So we must learn how to dessiminate and categorize information efficiently.

Let's imagine, for this instance, that you are a team of interns, and you have been tasked with creating a report that assesses a company's information systems and information technology. We'll get more specific later. First, you need to know the essential terminology, concepts and features that you will be assessing. In the week 1 folder there are 2 introductory texts: 1 by MIT and 1 by Saylor. You need to scan through each of these papers to list and categorize all key terms, concepts and features that you will include in your assessment. And you only have 90 minutes to do this. So break into groups of 4, divide responsibilities between you, and get as far as you can. Don't be overwhelmed though the information is overwhelming. Find the way to work together so you can accomplish more as a team than you can alone.  

Read the Saylor text chapters 1-2 and the MIT text until section 1.4. (And in case you were wondering, yes the MIT text is a more challenging read) 

Enter, organize and format your data however it best makes sense to you [in this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wp27CPZOgCh5gRY25ixhe5qgbm6cmxw_HAFr098hdjY/edit?usp=sharing) under the tab of your group (will assign in class). Include your names in the top row to get credit.
